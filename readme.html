<p>The purpose of this app to to query urls to determine if they are present in the APWG database.</p>
<p>
    The filters determine how the url is looked up in the database.
    <ul>
        <li>URL_exact - query the database exactly with the url provided</li>
        <li>domain - query the database using only the domain of the url</li>
        <li>url - query the database using everything before the path of the url. This will return many results if https:// or any other common URL components are included</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Sanitize_url - removes the path of the url, this is to exclude any sensitive information that might be in the the url. Note: THIS DOES NOT WORK WITH URL_exact
</p>
